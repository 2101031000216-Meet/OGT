                In men's limited-overs cricket, India made its ODI and T20I debuts in 1974 and 2006, respectively. The
                team has won five
                major ICC tournaments, winning the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and 2011), the ICC T20 World Cup once
                (2007) and the
                ICC Champions Trophy twice (2002 and 2013) and have also finished as runners-up in the World Cup once
                (2003), the T20
                World Cup once (2014), and the Champions Trophy twice (2000 and 2017). The team were also part of ICC
                World Test
                Championship finals in the first two editions (2019–21, 2021–23). It was the second team after the West
                Indies to win
                the World Cup and the first team to win the World Cup on home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket World
                Cup.
